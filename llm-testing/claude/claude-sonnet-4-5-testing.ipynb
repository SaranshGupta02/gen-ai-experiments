      "# Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Model Context Protocol is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that standardizes how AI applications connect to external data sources and tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Concepts\n",
      "\n",
      "**Purpose**: MCP solves the problem of AI systems needing to integrate with many different data sources (databases, APIs, file systems, etc.) by providing a universal standard for these connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How It Works\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP uses a client-server architecture:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **MCP Hosts**: AI applications (like Claude Desktop, IDEs) that want to access external context\n",
      "- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients maintained by the host application\n",
      "- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that expose specific data or tools through the standardized protocol\n",
      "- **Local Data Sources**: The systems your servers connect to (databases, files, APIs, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Main Features\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Resources**: Allow servers to expose data (files, database records, etc.) that AI models can read\n",
      "2. **Prompts**: Pre-written templates that users can invoke for common tasks\n",
      "3. **Tools**: Functions that AI models can call to perform actions or retrieve information\n",
      "\n",
      "## Benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Interoperability**: Build integrations once, use across any MCP-compatible application\n",
      "- **Security**: Keeps data local when desired, with user control over permissions\n",
      "- **Simplicity**: Easier than building custom integrations for each AI tool\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like USB-C for AI applications - a universal connector that works everywhere instead of needing different adapters for each device.\n"
