# Scrape Latest Jobs with AI using Make.com

This workshop demonstrates how to build an automated job scraping and resume customization system using Make.com (formerly Integromat). The workflow combines web scraping, AI-powered content generation, and automation to help job seekers find relevant positions and tailor their resumes accordingly.

## üéØ What You'll Build

A two-part automation system that:

1. **Scrapes job listings** from Indeed using Apify
2. **Customizes resumes** using OpenAI GPT-4 to match specific job requirements

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting this workshop, you'll need:

- **Make.com account** (free tier available)
- **Apify account** for web scraping
- **OpenAI API key** for GPT-4 access
- Basic understanding of automation workflows
- A sample resume in text format

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Make.com Setup
1. Sign up for a [Make.com account](https://make.com)
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. Create a new scenario

### 2. Apify Integration
1. Create an [Apify account](https://apify.com)
2. Get your Apify API token from your account settings
3. In Make.com, add Apify connection using your API token

### 3. OpenAI Integration
1. Get your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)
2. In Make.com, add OpenAI connection using your API key

## üîÑ Workflow Overview

### Part 1: Job Scraping (`1. Run Indeed Bulk Jobs Scraper.blueprint.json`)

This workflow:
- Uses Apify's Indeed scraper actor (`misceres/indeed-scraper`)
- Searches for jobs based on configurable parameters:
  - **Country**: IN (India) - customizable
  - **Position**: "web developer" - customizable
  - **Max Items**: 5 jobs per run
  - **Unique Items Only**: Prevents duplicates

**Key Configuration:**
```json
{
    "country": "IN",
    "followApplyRedirects": false,
    "maxItems": 5,
    "parseCompanyDetails": false,
    "position": "web developer",
    "saveOnlyUniqueItems": true
}
```

### Part 2: Resume Customization (`2. Get Results from Indeed Bulk Job Scraper & Customize Resume.blueprint.json`)

This workflow:
1. **Triggers** when the job scraping is complete (webhook-based)
2. **Fetches** scraped job data from Apify dataset
3. **Processes** each job through OpenAI GPT-4 to:
   - Analyze job requirements
   - Customize the resume to match the job
   - Maintain work history while adapting skills and descriptions
   - Output in Markdown format

**AI Prompt Strategy:**
- System role: "You're a helpful, intelligent writing assistant"
- User instruction: Customize resume to match job requirements while keeping work places the same
- Output format: Markdown (ATX format)
- Model: GPT-4o-latest for best results

## üìÅ Files Included

- `1. Run Indeed Bulk Jobs Scraper.blueprint.json` - Job scraping workflow

- `README.md` - This documentation

## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Import Blueprints
1. In Make.com, create a new scenario
2. Click "Import Blueprint"
3. Upload `1. Run Indeed Bulk Jobs Scraper.blueprint.json`
4. Configure your Apify connection
5. Repeat for the second blueprint

### Step 2: Configure Job Search Parameters
Edit the job scraper configuration:
- Change `position` to your target job title
- Adjust `country` if needed
- Modify `maxItems` based on your needs

### Step 3: Customize Resume Template
In the second workflow:
- Replace the sample resume with your actual resume
- Ensure your resume follows a clear format
- Test with a single job first

### Step 4: Run the Automation
1. Execute the job scraping workflow
2. The resume customization workflow will automatically trigger
3. Review the customized resumes generated for each job

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Options

### Job Search Parameters
- **Position**: Any job title (e.g., "data scientist", "product manager")
- **Country**: Use country codes (US, UK, CA, AU, etc.)
- **Max Items**: Adjust based on your processing needs
- **Company Details**: Enable for more detailed company information

### Resume Customization
- **Temperature**: Adjust creativity (0.7 is balanced)

### Output Format
- Currently outputs Markdown
- Can be modified to output HTML, PDF, or plain text
- Easy to integrate with document generation tools

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
